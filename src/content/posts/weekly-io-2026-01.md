## 2026-01-09 Weekly I/O

This is the first week of my 12-week-year plan. I set 8 tasks, which are:

1. Read an English article (4 times) -- 3/4
2. Listen to an English podcast or a YouTube video for 20-30 minutes (2 times) -- 2/2 ✅
3. Record 3-5 English vocabularies in my Notion (4 times) -- 4/4 ✅
4. Workout (4 times) (4/4) ✅
5. Read a chapter of Essential Typescript (2 times) -- 2/2 ✅
6. Read a chapter of Clean Code (2 times) -- 2/2  ✅
7. Write an English Weekly I/O ✅
8. Find an issue that I might be able to submit a PR for ✅

This week's completion rate is 87%, which is great in my opinion.

All the English articles I read were about JavaScript. One of them was about "React Signals," a trending way to manage state, and the rest were about JavaScript trends in 2025. I watched two YouTube videos: one was about "China planning to invade Taiwan," and another was about "how to stay focused."

I read 2 chapters of Essential Typescript, and I think I can read more next week since each chapter is only about 3 or 4 pages. Reading 1 chapter of Clean Code at a time works well for me.

I plan to keep most of the same goals next week, but I'll adjust some of them. For example, since I have already found an issue to work on, next week my target would be to submit a PR to fix that issue.

I never thought I would start planning and managing my time, because I had tried for years and always failed. I think the reason I can do it this time is that the goals are measurable and not too hard. I hope I can achieve my goals next week too.
