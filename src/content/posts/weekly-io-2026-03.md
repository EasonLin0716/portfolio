This is the third week of my 12-week-year plan. I set 8 tasks for myself:

1. Read an English article (4 times) -- 2/4 ❌
2. Listen to an English podcast or YouTube video for 20-30 minutes (2 times) -- 0/2 ❌
3. Record 3-5 English vocabulary words in Notion (4 times) -- 2/4 ❌
4. Work out (4 times) -- 4/4 ✅
5. Read 2 chapters of Essential TypeScript (2 times) -- 1/2 ❌
6. Read a chapter of Clean Code (2 times) -- 2/2 ✅
7. Write an English Weekly I/O ✅
8. Submit a Pull Request ❌

I spent most of my free time playing Baldur's Gate 3, and that's why only 37% of my tasks are complete this week. However, I do not feel guilty at all, and I think this is good.

One of the most important principles of the 12-week-year plan is NOT TO JUDGE YOURSELF, since failure is never bad—at least it's better than quitting this plan.

I will try harder next week, and hope that the pull request can be submitted.
