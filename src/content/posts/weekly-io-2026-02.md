This is the second week of my 12-week-year plan. I set 8 tasks for myself:

1. Read an English article (4 times) -- 4/4 ✅
2. Listen to an English podcast or YouTube video for 20-30 minutes (2 times) -- 2/2 ✅
3. Record 3-5 English vocabulary words in Notion (4 times) -- 4/4 ✅
4. Work out (4 times) -- 4/4 ✅
5. Read 2 chapters of Essential TypeScript (2 times) -- 2/2 ✅
6. Read a chapter of Clean Code (2 times) -- 2/2 ✅
7. Write an English Weekly I/O ✅
8. Submit a Pull Request ✅

This week's completion rate is 100%, which is great!

I spent about 2 hours working on an issue for PrimeVue related to its Tree component. I successfully fixed the issue and submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/primefaces/primevue/pull/8369), which I hope will be accepted.

I read 2 English articles this week—one about React Compiler and another about productivity. I also watched 3 YouTube videos: two about bread-making and one about the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Overall, this week felt well-balanced—challenging enough to keep me engaged, but not overwhelming. I'd like to maintain this level of difficulty. Next week, I plan to tackle a known issue in RustStack.
